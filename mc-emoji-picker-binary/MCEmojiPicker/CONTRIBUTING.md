# Contributing

Here provided info about contribution process and recommendations.

## Codestyle

I try to follow the [Ray Wenderlich](https://github.com/RedMadRobot/RMR-swift-style-guide) code style. Please observe it too in this repository.

## Apps Using section

To add your application to this list, just add this line of code to [README.md](https://github.com/izyumkin/MCEmojiPicker/blob/main/README.md) file by replacing only the application identifiers with yours.

```
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1521429599"><img src="http://izyumkin.ru/MCEmojiPicker/AppsUsing/id1521429599.png" height="65"></a>
```

> ❗️ Don't worry when your apps logo doesn't load after the contributing. I'll take care of it when I see your Pull Request.
